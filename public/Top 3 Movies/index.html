    <h1>The Best Movies According to Britni</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of ALL-TIME.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Scary Movie</h3>
    <p>The Wayans brothers are always funny.</p>
    <h3>Blade</h3>
    <p>Really cool sci-fi movie about a black vampire hunter.</p>
    <h3>Zombieland</h3>
    <p>I like the "How-to guide" style the movie is filmed in with the tips and tricks the main character comes up with.</p>
